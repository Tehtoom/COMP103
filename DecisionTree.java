/**
 * Implements a decision tree that asks a user yes/no questions to determine a decision.
 * Eg, asks about properties of an animal to determine the type of animal.
 * 
 * A decision tree is a tree in which all the internal nodes have a question, 
 * The answer to the question determines which way the program will
 *  proceed down the tree.  
 * All the leaf nodes have the decision (the kind of animal in the example tree).
 *
 * The decision tree may be a predermined decision tree, or it can be a "growing"
 * decision tree, where the user can add questions and decisions to the tree whenever
 * the tree gives a wrong answer.
 *
 * In the growing version, when the program guesses wrong, it asks the player
 * for another question that would help it in the future, and adds it (with the
 * correct answers) to the decision tree.
